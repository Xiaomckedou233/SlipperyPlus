Well,I'm not entirely sure what to put here, but this is a refabric version with high version Minecraft of [this mod](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/slippery-mod).

One bug I know of is that the local client can cause lag when switching between Creative. At this current moment I don't know how to fix it but I will try to see if I can find anything.
